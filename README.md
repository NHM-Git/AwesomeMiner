## GPU MINING

+ Native overclocking
Use the Native overclocking to control the clock speed, voltage, power and fan              
properties of your GPU's. Awesome Miner provides the unique feature of
performing overclocking operations for both AMD and nVidia GPU's without using
any external applications.

In addition to the native overclocking feature, clocking can also be performed via
remote control of MSI Afterburner.

The overclocking can automatically be applied at a large scale across an entire
mining farm based on the current mining algorithm.

+ Profit switching
The Profit switching feature will optimize the mining for maximum profitability              
based on statistics from both standard mining pools and multi-coin pools. Access all
popular mining pools with just a click to get started with the profit based mining
right away.

Use the benchmark to let Awesome Miner test multiple mining algorithms and
mining software and measure the hashrate and power usage for each of them to
optimize the profit switching decisions.

+ Power consumption
The current Power consumption is displayed for both AMD and nVidia GPU's,
independent of which mining software being used. The mining profit is calculated
and displayed in real time based on the current power consumption, hashrate and
the current mining pool.

+ Any crypto currency, Any software
Includes support for over 40 of the most popular mining software. Several hundred
crypto currencies are included with statistics and revenue information. Full
flexibility to add and deploy any custom mining software, algorithm, crypto
currency and mining pool.

+ GPU monitoring
Display and monitor GPU properties including clock speed, fan speed, power
consumption and temperature. Define actions to take in case a GPU is failing or
running too warm.

+ Windows and Linux
Manage and monitor GPU miners running on either Windows or Linux. Awesome
Miner Remote Agent supports both platforms.


## ASIC MINING


+ ASIC support
Manage and monitor all popular ASIC devices without installing any software on the        
device. Use profit switching on ASIC miners to prioritize mining on the most
profitable pool.

Supported ASIC miners includes, but are not limited to: Bitmain Antminer, Baikal,
Canaan Avalon, DragonMint, Hyperbit, iBeLink, Innosilicon, Obelisk and Whatsminer.

+ Antminer
Bitmain Antminer is a popular ASIC miner and all Antminer models are fully                  
supported, including features for automatic configuration of Privileged API access,
firmware upgrades and configuration of default pools.

+ Automation and SSH
Automate the mining operations by defining triggers and macros where the ASIC
miner can be instructed to perform operations like changing mining pool or
rebooting the ASIC miner. Any SSH command can be sent to an ASIC miner, for
example to force a reboot or shudown.

+ Optimized Antminer firmware
Use the optimized Antminer firmware to get significant hashrate improvements
and more features. The firmware supports display of power usage, LED flash,
sleep mode, antivirus scan and multiple predefined hashrate modes. All these
features are integrated in Awesome Miner. Supports Antminer S9, S9i, S9j, T9+,
L3+, S17, S17 Pro, T17

Awesome Miner can also interact with the open source Antminer firmware
provided by Braiins-OS


FEATURES


Notifications and Recovery
Use the predefined rules or define custom rules to take full control of the mining            
operations. Detection of high temperatures, slow mining progress, hanging miners
and disconnected miners. Automatic restart of miners, with fully customizable
triggers and actions. Define custom rules to automate tasks and setup schedules.

Notifications are displayed in the user interface and can also be sent by e-mail or
web hooks. With a Cloud Services subscription also as Telegram App notifications
and SMS messages.
API
Use the HTTP API to interact with Awesome Miner from external applications and          
get access to monitoring information about the miners. Use the API to provision
and control the mining via external applications.

Use the powerful built-in C# script engine to create customized triggers and actions.
Develop custom C# scripts for monitoring and performing mining and pool
operations.

Dashboard & Mining history
The dashboard gives an overview of all running miners and their total performance,
revenue, profit and power consumption.

View long-term mining history, generate charts and export CSV-data to Excel for
even more powerful data processing and visualization.

Organize miners
Organize your miners using miner groups to make management of larger number
of miners easier. Operations can be performed either on individual miners or on
one or many groups of miners.

Define and assign tags to miners to filter and make it easier to identify properties of
a miner.

Templates
Use templates to apply a predefined configuration to one or many miners in
a single operation.

Balance monitoring
Monitor your assests using Coin wallet balance feature and the Pool balance
feature for the most popular mining pools.
